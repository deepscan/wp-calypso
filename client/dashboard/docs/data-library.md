# Data Library and Layers

## Overview

The dashboard uses a light approach to data fetching and state management. It leverages [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) (formerly React Query) for server state management and avoids Redux in favor of a more direct, hooks-based approach.

## Architecture

The data library is organized around these key principles:

1. **REST API-centric**: All data is fetched from the WordPress.com REST API
2. **Type safety**: Strong TypeScript types for all data structures
3. **Data separation**: Clear separation between fetching logic and UI components
4. **Caching**: Simple caching strategies for optimized performance: Load from local cache first and refetch on navigation/focus.
5. **Loader pattern**: Data is prefetched through route loaders where possible

The data library consist of two layers:

- data source
- data queries (with state management)

## Data source: `client/dashboard/data/`

This layer exports the API integration with the REST API, and the data types that are consumed by the dashboard components.

### API integration

The data source layer uses `wpcom` from `calypso/lib/wp` for REST API calls. Each data requirement has corresponding fetch functions in `client/dashboard/data/<endpoint-group>.ts`. For example:

`client/dashboard/data/site-reset.ts`:

```typescript
export async function fetchSiteResetStatus( siteId: number ): Promise< SiteResetStatus > {
	return wpcom.req.get( {
		path: `/sites/${ siteId }/reset-site/status`,
		apiNamespace: 'wpcom/v2',
	} );
}
```

We usually return the raw response from the API. If you need to process the response (e.g. filter), you can do so in the query layer via TanStack's [select](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/render-optimizations#select) option.

### Data types

The data source layer defines clear TypeScript interfaces for the data structures returned / consumed by the endpoints, in the same file as the fetch functions. For example:

`client/dashboard/data/site-reset.ts`:

```typescript
export type SiteResetStatus = {
	status: 'in-progress' | 'ready' | 'completed';
	progress: number;
};
```

An "index" (or "barrel") `client/dashboard/data/types.ts` is provided, which re-exports all data types from all endpoints. This allows for easy import of all data types from the dashboard components. Import types using `import type ...` syntax to avoid the disadvantages of barrel files.

## Data queries (fetching and mutation): `client/dashboard/app/queries/`

The dashboard uses a combination of route loaders and component-level queries to fetch data, all using TanStack Query. This allows for both prefetching data for routes and fetching data on-demand within components.

### Queries object centralization

Queries are reused between loaders and components. To encourage cache reusability between different parts of the app, we centralize the queries definitions in the `client/dashboard/app/queries/` directory.

The query layer does not export hooks; it only exports the option objects which are passed to hooks (e.g. `useQuery()`). This makes the queries more reusable. You won't always want to use `useQuery()`, sometimes depending on the situation you may need `useSuspenseQuery()` or `queryClient.getQueryData()`. These all accept the same query options object. It also makes queries more easily composable. When your component has some unique requirement other queries don't, you do not need to parameterize the query optionsâ€”you can compose your own query options:

```typescript
useQuery( {
	...siteResetStatusQuery( site.ID ),
	select: ( data ) => data.status,
	enabled: transferStatus.status !== 'completed',
} );
```

### `queryOptions` and `mutationOptions`

React Query's tyes are very fancy. The downside is they can be hard to get write when written by hand. That is why React Query provides the `queryOptions` and `mutationOptions` utility functions.

At runtime these functions are a no-op. But by you using them your editor will give you code completion and TypeScript will be able to confirm they are well formed. Callback functions like `onSuccess` and `select` in particular are tricky when you have to provide your own parameter types. These utility functions define the types for you.

### Route loaders

The primary data-fetching pattern uses route loaders to prefetch data before rendering components:

```typescript
const siteSettingsPHPRoute = createRoute( {
	getParentRoute: () => siteRoute,
	path: 'settings/php',
	loader: async ( { params: { siteSlug } } ) => {
		const site = await queryClient.ensureQueryData( siteBySlugQuery( siteSlug ) );
		if ( hasHostingFeature( site, HostingFeatures.PHP ) ) {
			await queryClient.ensureQueryData( sitePHPVersionQuery( site.ID ) );
		}
	},
} ).lazy( () =>
	import( '../sites/settings-php' ).then( ( d ) =>
		createLazyRoute( 'site-settings-php' )( {
			component: () => <d.default siteSlug={ siteRoute.useParams().siteSlug } />,
		} )
	)
);
```

TanStack's `queryClient.ensureQueryData` checks if data is already cached before fetching, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary requests.

### Component-level queries

At the component level, we use the `useQuery` and `useSuspenseQuery` hooks to fetch data. This includes the data that we preloaded in the route loader:

```typescript
const { data: currentVersion } = useSuspenseQuery( {
	...sitePHPVersionQuery( site.ID ),
	enabled: hasHostingFeature( site, HostingFeatures.PHP ),
} );
```

as well as data that are specific to a component that you want to load dynamically:

```typescript
const { data: siteContentSummary, isLoading } = useQuery(
	siteResetContentSummaryQuery( site.ID )
);
```

## Adding new data sources

To add a new data source to the dashboard:

1. Create fetch functions and related types in `client/dashboard/data/<endpoint-group>.ts`.
2. Define a new query in `client/dashboard/app/queries/` if needed.
3. Use the query in a router loader or component.

### Example: adding a new data entity

`client/dashboard/data/entity.ts`:

```typescript
// Define the type
export interface NewEntity {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  // other properties...
}

// Create the fetch function
export async function fetchNewEntity( id: string ): Promise< NewEntity > {
  return wpcom.req.get( {
    path: `/entity/${id}`,
    apiNamespace: 'rest/v1.1',
  } );
}
```

`client/dashboard/app/queries/entity.ts`:

```typescript
// Define the query
export const newEntityQuery = ( id: string ) => queryOptions( {
	queryKey: [ 'newEntity', id ],
	queryFn: () => fetchNewEntity( id ),
	staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
} );
```

```typescript
// Use in a component
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery( newEntityQuery( id ) );

// Use in a route loader
loader: ( { params: { id } } ) =>
  queryClient.ensureQueryData( newEntityQuery( id ) ),
```

# Internationalization (i18n)

## Overview

The dashboard uses @wordpress/i18n, and functions from @automattic/i18n-utils. Avoid using @automattic/i18n-calypso as it's to be deprecated.

The goal is to make all user-facing strings translatable while keeping the translator experience as simple and error-free as possible.

## Translation

Translators should not need to manage HTML tags or complex placeholders. If formatting (e.g., bold) is always required, apply it in code instead.

### ❌ Complex Approach

```tsx
createInterpolateElement(
	sprintf(
		/* translators: %(newOwnerEmail)s - the new owner's email */
		__( 'Invitation sent to <strong>%(newOwnerEmail)s</strong>' ),
		{
			newOwnerEmail,
		}
	),
	{
		strong: <strong />,
	}
)
```

### ✅ Preferred Approach

```tsx
createInterpolateElement(
	__( 'Invitation sent to <newOwnerEmail />' ), {
		newOwnerEmail: <strong>{ newOwnerEmail }</strong>,
	}
)
```

## CSS

The dashboard does not depend on Calypso's autortl processing. That is, there is not a separate CSS code for LTR and RTL languages. All languages use the same CSS code.

This is achieved by using CSS logical properties and values. Lint rules will ensure the correct CSS properties are used.

### ❌ Hardcoded LTR Layout Approach

```css
.my-class {
  padding-left: 5px;
  padding-right: 5px;
  left: 1px;
}
```

### ✅ Preferred Approach

```css
.my-class {
	padding-inline: 5px;
	inset-inline-start: 1px;
}
```

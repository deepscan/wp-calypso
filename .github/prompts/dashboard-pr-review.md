# Code Review Instructions

## Primary Objective

Verify that the PR follows the rules in @.claude/rules/dashboard.md.

Read @.claude/rules/dashboard.md before reviewing.

## Method

- Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to post feedback directly on specific lines.
- Provide fix suggestions in each comment.
- Don't nitpick minor style issues unless they violate project guidelines.
- Before suggesting alternative implementations, check if the PR description already addresses why that approach wasn't used.

## Output Format

- Be concise.
- Do NOT use checkboxes, todo lists, or progress indicators.
- Only comment if there are issues worth addressing.
- DO NOT comment on lines that are not related to the rules in @.claude/rules/dashboard.md.
